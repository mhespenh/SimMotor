Usage:
        Compile both SimMotor and Multicopter_Simulator
        Make sure you change the PATH to the SimMotor binary in the constructor
            in MulticopterSimulator.cpp to match your directory structure!
        Run Multicopter_Simulator from the command line and enjoy

Changelog:
        03/21/2012 - Initial Version -MAH

        03/23/2012 - Successfully implemented DBus message passing -MAH
        03/25/2012 - Implemented a rough example of QSharedMemory -MAH
        03/26/2012 - Successfully implemented qProcesses! -MAH
        03/28/2012 - Implmented a VERY basic angle-based PID motor controller -MAH

Notes:
        Basic PID info:  What it does now- you set the angle the craft is currently at (angle)
        then you set the angle you want to get to (setPoint), then let it run.  It will vary
        the motor throttle until it hits the correct angle, then keep it there.  Notice the throttle
        will always stay at 25% when stable- this is to correct for gravity :)
