Usage:
        Compile both SimMotor and Multicopter_Simulator
        Make sure you change the PATH to the SimMotor binary in the constructor
            in MulticopterSimulator.cpp to match your directory structure!
        Run Multicopter_Simulator from the command line.
        Then run MulticopterGUI to view the simulation in progress.

        You really shouldn't need to (read: shouldn't) make any changes
            to this class.  Just compile and move on.

Changelog:
        03/21/2012 - Initial Version -MAH
                   - Changed all references to "Engine" to "Motor" -MAH
        03/23/2012 - Successfully implemented DBus message passing -MAH
        03/25/2012 - Implemented a rough example of QSharedMemory -MAH
        03/26/2012 - Successfully implemented qProcesses! -MAH
        03/28/2012 - Implmented a VERY basic angle-based PID motor controller -MAH

Notes:
        Basic PID info:  What it does - you set the angle the craft is currently
        at (angle) then you set the angle you want to get to (target), then let it
        run.  It will vary the motor throttle until it hits the correct angle, then
        keep it there.
